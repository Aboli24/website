title: CindyJS Overview
---

**CindyJS is a framework to create interactive
(mathematical) content for the web.**

It aims to be compatible with [Cinderella](http://cinderella.de/),
providing an interpreter for the scripting language CindyScript
as well as a set of geometric operations which can be used to describe
constructions.
Together, these components make it very easy to visualize various
concepts, from geometry in particular and mathematics in general,
but also from various other fields.

## Examples

Examples on the web can be seen [here](http://science-to-touch.com/CJS/).

There is also [an `examples` directory](/examples/)
inside the repository, demonstrating individual functions and operations.

## Getting started

The [Documentation](/docs/) contains a section to get you started
using CindyJS.

## Bugs and feature requests

If something doesn't work the way you want it or need it,
feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/CindyJS/CindyJS/issues)
in our GitHub ticket system.
Be sure to check for known issues first, though.
