title: CindyGL Tutorial
---

You want to learn how to program applets as in [our CindyGL-gallery](/gallery/cindygl/)? We will introduce how such applets can be created from scratch.

### [Starting with Live-Coding](livecoding.html)

We recommend starting to get acquainted with basic CindyScript and the `colorplot` command by following [our live coding tutorial](livecoding.html).

### [Creating Applets with CindyGL](creatingapplets.html)

Once you know some CindyScript and understood the colorplot command, [you are ready to create your HTML applets](creatingapplets.html).

### [Reading and Writing Textures](textures.html)

[In the third part of the tutorial](textures.html) you will learn how to read from textures or the webcam, how to write to textures and you will generate applications that use feedback loops. The tutorial includes some live-coding.

### [GPGPU computations](gpgpu.html)

Since CindyGL accelerates code on the GPU, it can also be used for browser-based GPGPU computations. In [the fourth part of the tutorial](gpgpu.html) we will use texture feedback loops to compute the Game of Life and simulate a reaction diffusion system on the GPU.

### [Example-Gallery](/gallery/cindygl/)

A further good way to learn about different possibilities is to look at the source code of several applets in the [CindyGL-gallery](/gallery/cindygl/) or the [CindyGL-examples included in the repository](/examples/cindygl/).
